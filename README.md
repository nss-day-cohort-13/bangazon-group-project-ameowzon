# aMeowZon

Group project ( 5 day timeline August 2016) to demonstrate knowledge learned during Nashville Software School's 6 month bootcamp backend (Python) curriculum. 
Command Line Interface faux-shopping app written in Python with 5-table database. Written in two stages: first with Pickle serialization, then with integration of SQL to manage data. Other features include Curser display, fully backwards/forwards traversable menu, and test suite with 100% coverage.  

Written with [Joseph Kane](https://github.com/josephkane), [Chase Ramsey](https://github.com/chase-ramsey) and [Sulaiman Allen](https://github.com/sulaiman-allen). I contributed heavily to app design inluding composition of ERD; wrote cart, user, and payment modules and shop, add-to-cart, and payment menus; and wrote all SQL-iteration testing.
